### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## <span style="color:#FF004F;">I'm Asiphe Ndimlana - a dreamer, creator and enthusiast</span>



I've completed a full-stack web development course at Life Choices Academy and I'm currently pursuing an AWS certificate at LC Studio. My passion for coding and IT started in high school, where I first dabbled in programming using Delphi 10. After high school, I eagerly enrolled at LC Academy to dive into the IT industry. Throughout my journey, I've gained expertise in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Coding is more than a career; it's a cherished hobby that I'm passionate about. In my free time, I enjoy football, movies, series, and chess.
